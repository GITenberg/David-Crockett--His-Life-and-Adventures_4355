description: Tennessee soldier and politician David Crockett played a significant
  role in his home state's history, but it is his legendary skill as a frontiersman
  and hunter that earned him an outsized reputation, eventually landing him a spot
  in the pantheon of American folk heroes. This engaging volume combines a factual
  account of Crockett's life along with some of the tall tales and over-the-top adventures
  with which he is credited.
